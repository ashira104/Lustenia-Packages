Below is a list of Mudlet packages, what they do, and if they have an aliases help pop-up. Those notated with * use the Stopinator, so be aware if you download more than one package including it that you will need to remove the additional instances of the Stopinator.

 - Celest Power Quest*
   - CPHELP for a pop-up with commands.
   - Will assist with the power quest for Celest.

COMING SOON:
 - Celest Epic Quest

Any questions or suggestions, I'm reachable on Discord as A-She-Ra#1046.
