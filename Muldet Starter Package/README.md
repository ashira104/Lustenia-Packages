**NOTE: At this time, the file needs to be unzipped and each module installed individually. A fix is being worked on for this. Thank you for your patience.**

Enclosed are several modules that you can add or remove as you like, as they are not tied in to each other. These packages are from various sources, released with the permission of the coder, and each coder credited for their work. Once you have installed everything you wish to install, restart Mudlet, as some of the packages require this.
