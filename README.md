Welcome Lusternians! Each city/commune has their own folder for things specific to them. The only exception is all of the Nexus user packages are in the Nexus Packages folder, regardless of general use or city/commune.

If you are new to Mudlet, I recommend the Mudlet Start Package as your first step. There is a README in the folder as well as the zip file with what each package does, how to operate it, and credit to the creator.

For the more experienced user, the General Use (by Ashira) and Packages by Others folders have the same modules in the starter package, plus more.

Each folder has its own README file with what the packages do.

Any questions or suggestions, I'm reachable on Discord as a-she-ra.
