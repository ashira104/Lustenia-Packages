Below is a list of Mudlet packages, what they do, and if they have an aliases help pop-up. Those notated with * use the Stopinator, so be aware if you download more than one package including it that you will need to remove the additional instances of the Stopinator.

 - Continuum Polyhedron Feeder*
   - COHELP for a pop-up with commands.
   - Will assist with feeding crystals to the polyhedrons on Continuum.
 - Hallifax Primary Generator
   - GENHELP for a pop-up with commands.
   - Will assist in producing appropriate sphere colours for the Primary Generator.

Any questions or suggestions, I'm reachable on Discord as A-She-Ra#1046.
