Below is a list of Mudlet packages, what they do, and if they have an aliases help pop-up. Those notated with * use the Stopinator, so be aware if you download more than one package including it that you will need to remove the additional instances of the Stopinator.

 - Magnagora Epic Quest*
   - SAHELP for a pop-up with commands.
   - Will help with various portions of the Magnagora Epic Quest as detailed in the pop-ups.
 - Spectres Power Quest*
   - POWER HELP for a pop-up with commands.
   - Will help with various portions of the Spectre Power Quest for Magnagora.

Any questions or suggestions, I'm reachable on Discord as A-She-Ra#1046.
